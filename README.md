# until-lab

This code will start at one as it's int x.

I used two different functions, one that returns a boolean of true once x is greater than 100. The other will multiply x by 2 each time.

the until function will use the two other functions declares till x is more than 100. The code will then return the number that it ends with onces x is greater than 100.
